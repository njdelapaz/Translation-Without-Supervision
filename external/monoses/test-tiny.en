 Prague Stock Market falls to minus by the end of the trading day 
 After a sharp drop in the morning, the Prague Stock Market corrected its losses. 
 Transactions with stocks from the Czech Energy Enterprise (ČEZ) reached nearly half of the regular daily trading. 
 The Prague Stock Market immediately continued its fall from Monday at the beginning of Tuesday's trading, when it dropped by nearly six percent. 
 This time the fall in stocks on Wall Street is responsible for the drop. 
 The reaction of the market to the results of the vote in the American House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan for the stabilization of the financial sector there, has manifested itself here as well. 
 Stocks fall in Asia 
 Stocks in the Asian markets experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, even though the indexes ultimately erased a part of the losses during the day. 
 The Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange wrote off nearly four percent during the day, but later it erased a part of the losses and reduced the decrease to roughly 2.5 percent. 
 The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which follows the movement of Chinese stocks on the stock market in Hong Kong, dropped by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed. 
 Stocks on the market in Sydney lost more than five percent, but ultimately lowered their losses to 4.3 percent. 
 The stock exchange in Taiwan dropped by 3.6 percent according to the local index. 
 "The timing of the bailout action in the USA is uncertain and it will influence financial markets all over the world," remarked the head of the Hong Kong Currency Board, Joseph Yam. 
 Despite the fact that it is a part of China, Hong Kong determines its currency policy separately, that is, without being dependent on the Chinese Central Bank. 
 Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States. 
 American legislators should quickly return to their negotiations and approve the bill to support the financial system, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. 
 Otherwise there reputedly looms the threat that other countries will also feel the impacts. 
 American stock bloodbath 
 On Monday the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, into which up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 billion Czech crowns) was to be invested. 
 The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's appeal for them to support the plan. 
 According to Bush, the plan would tackle the basic causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy. 
 American stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday and the major stock indexes registered their greatest fall in more than 20 years. 
 The Dow Jones Index dropped by nearly seven percent, having registered a similarly-ranged fall the last time in 1987. 
 The index had dropped even prior to the vote, but as soon as it was revealed that the bill had not passed in the House, the index went into free fall. 
 Congress yields: US government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks 
 The top representatives of the American Congress and George W. Bush's cabinet have agreed upon a broader form of the agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system. 
 The vote on it will take place at the beginning of next week. 
 American legislators made a breakthrough in their talks about the approval of a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance for the American financial system amounting to 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 billion crowns). 
 But all is not won yet. 
 That is, the members of congress have to complete some details of the agreement before they can make the final version of the law public and vote on it. 
 The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday. 
 The chair of the Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters this on Sunday. 
 Sources say that the senate could evidently vote on the plan on Wednesday at the soonest. 
 Economists say that the announcement that the bailout plan will be approved should be the first psychological factor significant to the revival of financial markets. 
 Afterward, however, a "sobering up" will take place due to the complicated nature of the mechanisms with which assistance to the markets can be achieved in practice. 
 Paulson: Plan must be effective 
 "We've made great progress. 
 We've resolved our differing opinions on how the package for the stabilization of markets should look," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg. 
 According to her, the final vote could take place as early as Sunday. 
 Representatives of the legislators met with American Finance Minister Henry Paulson Saturday night in order to give the government fund a final form. 
 The fund is meant to purchase unsellable mortgage assets which are pulling financial companies down into heavy losses and are endangering the stability of the entire system. 
 "We're on the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan which will function and which also must be effective on the market. 
 It's necessary to continue in the curative plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said. 
 A signal for Asian trading 
 The global financial crisis is significantly impacting the stock markets, which are dropping sharply. 
 According to Nevada Democratic senator Harry Reid, that is how that legislators are trying to have Congress to reach a definitive agreement as early as on Sunday. 
 Namely, by doing this they want to calm investors prior to trading on the Asian financial markets, which, given their time zones, are the first ones where the decision by Congress could influence Monday's trading. 
 In the meantime, however, it is not yet clear with any certainty when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether the negotiations will not become hindered by some problem. 
 The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days. 
 However, the bill will still go through a series of changes. 
 The total amount designated for assistance to the system is to be divided into two parts. 
 The initial 350 billion dollars is to become available as soon as possible, as requested by president George Bush. 
 But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount, in the sequence of a further 100 billion dollars and later, the final 350 billion dollars, if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function. 
 Bush appreciates progress in negotiations 
 Though the president can veto this decision, Congress can override his veto. 
 Even in spite of these changes, the essential idea of the program, to gain finances for the buyout of bad mortgage stocks, the value of which had dropped because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay off their mortgages, has remained intact. 
 "We've drawn it all up. 
 The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican senator Judd Gregg. 
 Even American president Bush is satisfied with the progress in negotiations. 
 His speaker Tony Fratto declared that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciated the "two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and save our economy". 
 Constraining golden parachutes 
 The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said that the legislators had agreed upon the responsibilities for the financial program, protection of the taxpayers against losses, closing of relief packages, and timing of the financial plan. 
 The new law is also meant to constrain the "golden parachutes" for the heads of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee which will oversee the fund. 
 The committee is to be directed by the Ministry of Finance. 
 "We've worked very hard on this and we've made great progress toward an agreement that will work and that will be useful for all Americans," Paulson said. 
 The plan also includes assistance to homeowners who have problems making their payments. 
 The cabinet should negotiate new payments for the mortgages it buys, with the aim of lowering the monthly payment costs for those in debt and enabling them to keep their houses. 
 Marek: Psychological help 
 According to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult. 
 "And this is because it is not known through what mechanism and for what price the problematic assets will be bought. 
 This will determine how the financial sector and the cabinet will divide the losses amongst themselves," Marek told the server iHNed.cz this week. 
 Whether the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week is not so significant, according to Marek. 
 "More important is for the members of congress to agree this week to support the plan and to approve it as soon as possible. 
 The psychological significance of the agreement that the approval will take place is the most important thing at this time," Marek emphasized. 
 Razor's edge battle: MP3 players vs. cell phones. 
 Our advice on how to choose 
 While nearly every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls. 
 This makes it seem clear that it is better to only buy a phone. 
 In spite of this, there are many reasons to get a separate MP3 player. 
 The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and demands of the future owner. 
 It is not likely that you will get a top-of-the-line expensive record player in order to listen to the newest album by Maxim Turbulenc. 
 First of all such music products not available on LPs, but also, from the qualitative point of view there no objective reason for it. 
 However, if your shelves are crowded with art rock, jazz, or blues vinyl records, you are likely at least dreaming of a record player like that. 
 It's the same with music on trips, that is, compressed music, simply put, MP3 music. 
 There are price and qualitative categories here as well. 
 For some, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on an MP3 player, just as it is hard for Pink Floyd fan to accept twenty-crown headphones from a market hall. 
 Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone. 
 The selection is broad. 
 Battery life also decides 
 Some top-of-the-line music players can do much more than merely play music, but also what most cell phones can't even do by chance. 
 No contemporary machine is as universal as the telephone. 
 In addition to the primary functions, calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, contains a camera which is sometimes better and sometimes worse and can even navigate in some cases. 
 And when we take smart phones and communication devices, you have a small computer in your pocket. 
 It's a small miracle, as there is no refrigerator that knows how to grill and no television can take pictures. 
 The universal nature of the cell phone also brings disadvantages. 
 The more functions you use on your cell phone, the sooner the indicator on your display will send you running for the charger. 
 And playing music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers. 
 Very few cell phones can play music for longer than ten to twelve hours, most of them much less. 
 In this way, music players (particularly the simplest ones) are much more efficient. 
 Which is why you should count on the fact that inexpensive cell phones will not play for more than a few hours.
